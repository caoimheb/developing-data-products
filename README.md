# developing-data-products

This repository has been created as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialisation, for the Developing Data Products module. 

The project involves creating a shiny app. The finished application is available [here] (https://caoimheb.shinyapps.io/CourseProject).

There is also a presentation pitching the app. This is available [here] (http://caoimheb.github.io/developing-data-products/presentation/index.html).
