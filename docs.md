## Welcome to the Movie Budget Investigator

<br>

This application allows the user to investigate the budget spent on movies, and the effect this has on average movie rating. 

To examine the data at a more detailed level the user can check/uncheck the genres, and adjust the date range of the movies, from the control panel on the left hand side. The graphs will react according to the selections made. 

The data used in this application is a Movie Data Set, compiled from IMDB ratings. The data, and more information on it, can be found [here](http://had.co.nz/data/movies/). 

The data can also be examined and searched from the Data tab of the application.
